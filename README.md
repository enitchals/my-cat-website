# My Cat Website
A demo with extension problems using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

### demo-2 branch
The [demo-2 branch](https://github.com/enitchals/my-cat-website/tree/demo-2) started with the code from the demo branch, then added the "favorites" list. Here's what we did:
- added a `favorites` list to the App component and an "Add Favorite" button in the RandomPic component
- added a Gallery component to display our favorite cats
- organized our App component so the Gallery and RandomPic components are displayed one at a time, and the user can toggle between the views with buttons
