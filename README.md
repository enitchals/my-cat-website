# My Cat Website
A demo with extension problems using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

## demo-notes
This [demo-notes branch](https://github.com/enitchals/my-cat-website/tree/demo-notes) is a cleaned-up, annotated version of the code from the live demo. If you're wondering what a specific line of code from the demo does, this is a great place to learn more!

## Live Demo Goals
A high-level overview of what the live demo covered:

1. fetch a random cat pic from the API and display it
2. re-fetch the cat pic without refreshing the browser
3. get a random cat pic by breed
4. add a "favorite cats" list
5. add a gallery of favorite cats
6. organize our random cat pic and gallery into separate tabs/views
