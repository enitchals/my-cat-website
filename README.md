# My Cat Website
A demo with extension problems using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)


## Live Demo Goals
A high-level overview of what the live demo is going to cover:

1. ~~fetch a random cat pic from the API and display it~~
2. ~~re-fetch the cat pic without refreshing the browser~~
3. ~~get a random cat pic by breed~~
4. add a "favorite cats" list
5. add a gallery of favorite cats
6. organize our random cat pic and gallery into separate tabs/views
