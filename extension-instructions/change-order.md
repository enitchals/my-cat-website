## ðŸ”„ Change gallery list order
Make the gallery items appear with the newest additions at the beginning of the list. There are a couple different ways you could do this:
- change the order when you're adding a new imgUrl to the array
- use a flexbox property to modify the display order (hint: it's one of the first properties listed in the [Guide to CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))
